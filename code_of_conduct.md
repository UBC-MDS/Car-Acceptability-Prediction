# Team Code of Conduct

Our team's diverse skillsets, interests, and backgrounds is our secret sauce. We will support each other in learning and will foster a positive space for collaboration.

### Behaviour that contributes to creating a positive team environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Listening when others are talking
No bad ideas! Considering others perspectives
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the team
Showing empathy to others
Apologizing respectfully
Using each others' preferred pronouns

### Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Microaggressions
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing other teammates' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Reporting a problem

If you notice unacceptable behaviour, please 'call in' the team member's behaviour via Slack or during our in person meeting. A private DM is also available should you not want to publicly describe it. If you are 'called in', please listen to how your behaviour was not acceptable and deeply consider your teammate's perspectives.  

If the unacceptable behaviour persists, the next step is to alert the lab instructor of the unacceptable behaviour.

Consequences for unacceptable behaviour could include losing marks, facing a request to be removed from the team, and, if egregious, facing disciplinary action from the MDS Program or UBC.
